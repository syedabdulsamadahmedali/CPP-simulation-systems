## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Mini Key-Value Store (`mini-kv-store/`)
- Lightweight in-memory key-value storage engine with file persistence.
- Supports basic CRUD operations and safe concurrent access using mutexes.

### 2. Simple Physics Engine (`simple-physics-engine/`)
- Real-time 2D gravity simulation where balls fall and bounce off surfaces.
- Built with C++ and SFML for rendering.

### 3. Multithreaded Web Server (`multithreaded-webserver/`)
- TCP socket server capable of handling multiple concurrent client connections.
- Built with C++ threads and the Winsock2 API (Windows Sockets).

### 4. Lightweight 3D Simulation Engine (`lightweight-3d-engine/`)
- Modular real-time world simulation with basic physics and rendering.
- Built in C++ using SFML, with plans for expansion into:
  - Multithreaded physics updates
  - TCP networking for remote telemetry
  - AI prediction modules (optional future)
  - Persistence (saving world snapshots)
